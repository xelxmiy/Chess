/**
 * Chessnt - Chessn't
 * it's not chess!
 * it's also not *not* chess. it's somewhere in between.
 * chess variation where all of the pieces don't do what the usually do.
 * bad at chess? play this, your opponent won't know what's going on and neither
 * will you!
 * 
 * Note: this is not an online multiplayer game, nor does AI support.
 * Therefore to play it you require a second human in the room to do the opposing
 * turn. this is because I am lazy and don't want to make a chess AI.
